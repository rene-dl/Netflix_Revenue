# Netflix Revenue

Netflix, launched in 2007, is an american subscription video on demand over the top streaming service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.Â 

This project involved data analysis and visualization of Netflix subscriptions from 2021-2023. I analyzed the revenue by subscription type, country, age and device, creating interactive visuals to highlight key patterns and insights.

# Summary of Ideas

### Subscription Type
- In May 2022, subscriptions for the basic plan began to rise significantly, reaching a peak in July. Afterward, they fluctuated, reaching their highest in October before dropping sharply.
- The standard and premium plans showed similar patterns, although the standard plan peaked in July and did not see as much of an increase in October.

### Country
- The countries generating the most revenue are the United States and Spain, due to their larger user bases and the higher subscription rates in these markets.

### Age
- The average user age is 38, with the highest revenue generated by users aged 30 to 45.

### Devices
- There does not appear to be a specific device preference among users, as all devices show nearly similar values.

# Recommendations

- Investigate the reasons behind the significant increase in subscriptions from May to October 2022, followed by a sharp drop, to determine if this was due to product issues or market competition.

- Analyze the high performance in the United States and Spain to identify if marketing strategies, specific features, or promotions can be applied to other countries to boost revenue.

- Collaborate with the marketing team to reach more users under 25 and assess the viability of attracting users over 50.
